# Shared Secure Boot handling for the rcraid installers.  Sourced (not
# executed) by install-dkms.sh and install-livecd.sh, which need the same
# answers to the same questions: will this kernel refuse our module, which key
# signs it, and how does that key become trusted?
#
# rcraid.ko is out-of-tree, so a Secure-Boot-enforcing kernel rejects it unless
# it is signed with a key in MOK (or db): insmod fails with "Key was rejected
# by service" and dmesg says "Loading of unsigned module is rejected".
#
# Signing and enrolment are split across a reboot on purpose:
#
#   install time    put a key pair on disk, point DKMS at it (so every build,
#                   including kernel-update rebuilds, is signed), and queue a
#                   MokNew request in firmware
#   next boot       shim's MOK manager — which runs before the kernel — asks
#                   for the one-time password and enrolls the certificate, so
#                   the module that boot loads from initramfs is already
#                   signed by a key the kernel trusts
#
# That is one reboot, and it is the reboot the install needs anyway.  The other
# order (enrol, reboot, then install) costs two, and cannot work at all from a
# live USB: the live session's key lives in RAM, not on the target.
#
# The corollary is that a queued enrolment is a *promise* about the next boot.
# Anything that cannot verify the request is actually pending fails: a silent
# miss here is the "installs fine, array missing after reboot" failure that
# this file exists to prevent.
#
# RCRAID_ALLOW_SECURE_BOOT=1 tells the callers "I sign the modules myself";
# RCRAID_MOK_KEY / RCRAID_MOK_CERT override key discovery; RCRAID_MOK_PASSWORD
# sets the enrolment password instead of generating one; RCRAID_EFIVARS_DIR
# overrides the efivarfs path (for tests only).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Firmware state
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The SecureBoot EFI variable is read directly rather than via mokutil: the
# live-CD preflight runs before any packages are installed.  efivarfs layout
# is 4 bytes of attributes followed by the data; for SecureBoot the data is
# one byte, 1 = enforcing.  No efivarfs entry at all means a BIOS/CSM boot,
# where Secure Boot doesn't exist.
#
# The 5 bytes must be read from offset 0: efivarfs does not support seeking,
# so `od -j4` (and `dd skip=4`) fail with "Illegal seek" / "cannot skip past
# end of combined input" on every real efivar, which would make every probe
# take the fail-closed path below and report Secure Boot as enforcing even on
# machines that have it switched off.
#
# A variable that exists but can't be read (firmware EIO quirks happen on
# real boards) — or reads back empty/truncated, which od reports as SUCCESS
# with no output — FAILS CLOSED: assume enforcing, warn, and let the user
# decide via RCRAID_ALLOW_SECURE_BOOT=1.  Silently treating an anomalous
# variable as "not enforcing" would reproduce the exact only-fails-at-next-
# boot behavior this check exists to prevent.

!! SIGNING FINISHES AT THE NEXT BOOT — MOK ENROLMENT

rcraid is signed with ${MOK_CERT}, and that certificate is queued for
enrolment.  Signing is completed by the reboot that follows this install:
shim's MOK manager runs BEFORE the kernel, so the module in the initramfs is
already signed with a key that boot trusts.

  one-time password: ${MOK_PASSWORD:-<the password set when the request was queued>}

At the blue "MOK management" screen: Enroll MOK -> Continue -> Yes -> type the
password -> Reboot.  (MOK manager reboots by itself when it is done; that is
the same boot, not another install step.)

If you skip the prompt, the key stays untrusted: with Secure Boot enabled the
kernel then rejects rcraid.ko and the array is missing — and when / lives on
the array, that boot cannot complete at all.  Recovery is that same screen on
the following boot, or:

  sudo mokutil --import ${MOK_CERT}
  sudo reboot

This requires the boot chain to go through shim (the default on Ubuntu/Debian
and Fedora).  A kernel booted by firmware directly through its own EFI stub
never runs MOK manager — there Secure Boot has to stay off.
