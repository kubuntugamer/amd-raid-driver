 * AMD-RAID Linux driver — PCI-ID-based code-path dispatch
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2025-2026 Joey Troy and contributors.
 *
 * This file picks the hardware code path (AHCI vs NVMe vs stub) based on
 * the PCI device ID.  The behaviour mirrors what AMD's Windows driver
 * does in its FUN_140007d40, with one big simplification: the Windows
 * function does its selection via wcsncmp on the PnP HW-ID string + a
 * class-code byte from the StorPort service +0x3f0; on Linux the same
 * information is just sitting in pdev->device and pdev->class, so there
 * is no need to recreate the WDF class-bind dance (service +0x418).
 *
 * See docs/REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md for the full reasoning.

 * engineering of the AMD-RAID Windows driver binaries under DMCA
