Secure Boot is enforcing and the signing set-up above did not finish (usually
mokutil or openssl is missing).  Installing now would look successful and
leave the array absent after the next reboot — on a machine that boots from
the array, that boot cannot complete at all.

Fix what is reported above (usually `sudo apt install mokutil openssl`) and
re-run: the installer creates the key, signs with it, and queues the enrolment
that the post-install reboot completes.

If you sign the modules yourself, point the installer at your key:

  sudo RCRAID_MOK_KEY=/path/MOK.priv RCRAID_MOK_CERT=/path/MOK.der \
      ./install-dkms.sh

or set RCRAID_ALLOW_SECURE_BOOT=1 to have the installer skip signing entirely.

# 5. Persist AMD's documented boot-line module blacklist.
#
# AMD-RAIDXpert2 User Guide Rev 3.11 (June 2020), "Boot Options": add
# `modprobe.blacklist=ahci,nvme` to the Linux boot string.  The RAID Bottom
# presents as class 0x010802, which the kernel nvme driver matches by class,
# and the SATA variants look like AHCI controllers — both autoload during
# coldplug, before rcraid's probe can claim the functions.  The udev rule can
# take a verified member back afterwards; with this, nothing has to.
#
# It goes on the kernel command line rather than in modprobe.d because it must
# be in force before udev coldplug, initramfs included.  A module that step 2
# could not unload is backing a live device, so it is never blacklisted here.
