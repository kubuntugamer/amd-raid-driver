 * NVMe controller boot sequence (kept inline as documentation)
 *
 * For DEV_B000 (and any other CC_0108 device) the Windows AMD driver takes
 * its nvme.c code path, not the ahci.c one. See docs/REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md.
 * This file implements the standard NVMe 1.4 controller boot sequence:
 *
 *   1. Read CAP, snapshot MQES / DSTRD / TO.
 *   2. Disable controller (CC.EN = 0); wait for CSTS.RDY = 0.
 *   3. Allocate admin SQ + CQ (DMA-coherent, 4 KiB aligned, zeroed).
 *   4. Program AQA / ASQ / ACQ.
 *   5. Set CC (4 KiB pages, NVM cmd set, IOSQES=6, IOCQES=4, EN=1).
 *   6. Poll CSTS until RDY = 1 (or CFS = 1, or CAP.TO * 500 ms elapses).
 *
 * No commands are submitted from here. Once the controller is ready the
 * higher layers can issue Identify / Set Features / I/O queue creation.

 * for S4 the hibernation snapshot captures them.  Either way, the resume

 *
 * Before touching the controller we blk_mq_freeze_queue the volume:

 * complete.  Without the drain, commands outstanding at CC.EN=0 time
 * lose their completions forever, their bios never end, and the suspend
 * transition blocks on them indefinitely — a hard hang with the screen
 * already off (observed in the field with the rootfs on the volume:
 * journal writeback is almost always in flight when systemd-sleep runs).
 * Failing the in-flight I/O instead (reset_controller's drain_dead)
 * would be wrong here — this is healthy I/O, it must land.  If the
 * controller is genuinely wedged, .timeout fires and fails the stragglers,
 * so the freeze cannot wait forever.  Freeze is refcounted: each member's
 * suspend takes one reference (the first does the actual drain, the
 * second returns immediately) and each member's resume drops one.
