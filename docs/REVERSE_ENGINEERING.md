# Reverse-Engineering Reference

The authoritative record of what the AMD-RAID Windows driver actually does,
reverse-engineered from the shipped binaries, and how the Linux port mirrors
it. This is the single source of truth for the RE work; where an older doc
disagrees with this file, this file wins.

**Binaries analysed** (formerly under `drivers/windows/trx50/` — removed
from the tree; restore with `git checkout 69738ee -- drivers/` or
download from AMD):

| Binary | Version | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `rcbottom.sys` | 9.3.2-00255, 9.3.3-00291 | Per-PCI-device PnP driver: PCI/NVMe register programming, queue init, completion handling |
| `rcraid.sys` | 9.3.2-00255, 9.3.3-00291 | RAID virtualization layer: on-disk metadata, member config, RAID-level dispatch |
| `rccfg.sys` | both | User-space IOCTL surface for `rcadm`. Reference only — not ported |

Tooling: **Ghidra 12.1** headless (scripts in `scripts/ghidra/`) plus PyGhidra
for targeted decompiles. Raw extracts live under `docs/ghidra_output/`
(`rcbottom_9.3.2/`, `rcbottom_9.3.3/`, `rcraid_9.3.2/`). The Linux driver's
version string comes from the single-line `VERSION` file at the repo root
(injected by the Makefile) and names the AMD Windows release whose behavior
the port matches — currently `9.3.3.00291`. The geometry ground truth was
established on 9.3.2-00255 and re-verified on 9.3.3-00291 (see "Version
delta" below).

---

## Version delta: 9.3.2 vs 9.3.3

`rcraid.sys` is **NOT** byte-identical between the two releases (an early repo
note wrongly assumed it was, before the 9.3.3 binary was in the tree; corrected
2026-07-07):

| Binary | 9.3.2-00255 | 9.3.3-00291 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rcraid.sys` | SHA256 `f0a6fc8b…`, 560,576 B | SHA256 `3f241608…`, 563,528 B | +2,952 B |
| `rcbottom.sys` | 106,384 B | 108,352 B | +1,968 B (localized bounds checks) |
| `rccfg.sys` | — | −600 B | CVE-2024-21962 fix (config IOCTL input validation) |

The CVE-2024-21962 fix lives entirely in `rccfg.sys`, which the Linux port does
not use. A string/symbol diff of the two `rcraid.sys` builds shows the only
genuinely new functional symbol is `RC_HW_NVME_EjectDrive` (a hot-eject /
surprise-removal handler); every other differing string is just the version
bump `RC-932`→`RC-933` in embedded source paths. **The geometry/data-path code
is functionally identical between versions** — verified by re-running the
pipeline on 9.3.3 (see "rcraid geometry" below). So 9.3.3 is a maintenance /
security release, not a feature release, for the NVMe RAID0 path this port
targets.

### Tracking a new AMD release

When AMD ships a new Windows RAID driver (e.g. a future 9.3.4):

1. Extract the new `rcraid.sys` / `rcbottom.sys` / `rccfg.sys` into
   `drivers/windows/trx50/<version>/`.
2. Re-run the Ghidra pipeline on them ("Reproducing the analysis" below) and
   string/symbol-diff against the previous release, focusing on the geometry
   parser and the NVMe queue-init path.
3. Update this section with the findings; port any data-path change the diff
   surfaces.
4. Bump the single-line `VERSION` file at the repo root to the new release
   (e.g. `9.3.4.00xxx`) — the Makefile injects it into the module banner and
   `modinfo`; no code change is needed for the version itself.

## The AHCI vs NVMe code-path split

The single most load-bearing finding: **device `0xB000` (the TRX50 NVMe RAID
Bottom) takes a completely different code path than the AHCI SATA variants.**
Early analysis treated the controller as AHCI and programmed completion
registers at `BAR0 + 0x100 + qid*0x10` — those offsets are AHCI port registers
and are meaningless for `0xB000`, which is why writes there never persisted.

`FUN_140007d40` (once mislabelled "firmware capability parsing") is the
**callback-table installer** that switches paths on the PCI hardware ID:

```
                                     +-- ahci.c path (iVar7 == 1)
 PnP HW-ID = VEN_1022 & DEV_7905  ---+
 PnP HW-ID = VEN_1022 & DEV_7916  ---+
 PnP HW-ID = VEN_1022 & DEV_7917  ---+
 PnP HW-ID = VEN_1022 & DEV_43BD  ---+

                                     +-- nvme.c path (iVar7 == 2)
 ANY OTHER ID + (param_3 != 0)    ---+   <-- includes DEV_B000

 ANY OTHER ID + (param_3 == 0)    ---+-- stub path (iVar7 == 99, no-op vtable)
```

The internal AMD source files are named in embedded error strings:
`…\rcbottom\rcbottom\ahci.c` (at `FUN_1400021d4`, AHCI completion-register
install) and `…\rcbottom\rcbottom\nvme.c` (at `FUN_14000dd44`, NVMe queue
init). The third parameter to `FUN_140007d40` is `1` iff the PCI class-code
string contains `"CC_010802"` (NVMe class), read via StorPort service `+0x3f0`
opcode `2` in `FUN_140005ff4`. This matches the INF exactly:

| Device | INF class | param_3 | Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x7905 / 0x7916 / 0x7917 / 0x43BD | CC_0104 | 0 | AHCI (1) |
| 0xB000 | CC_0108 | 1 | **NVMe (2)** |

So `0xB000` is **always** NVMe.

### The installed vtable (`devExt+0x16100..0x16168`)

A 13-slot function-pointer table; `nvme.c` and `ahci.c` install different sets,
and the same outer code dispatches through them:

| Slot | AHCI (iVar7=1) | NVMe (iVar7=2) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `+0x16100` | FUN_140004090 | FUN_14000fafc | Primary dispatch |
| `+0x16108` | FUN_140001438 | FUN_14000c0bc | Cmd submit |
| `+0x16110` | **FUN_1400021d4** | **FUN_14000dd44** | Queue/CR init |
| `+0x16118` | FUN_140003f7c | FUN_14000303c | Cleanup |
| `+0x16120` | FUN_140003048 | FUN_14000e800 | Disable/quiesce |
| `+0x16128` | FUN_1400027a8 | LAB_14000918c | Mode toggle |
| `+0x16130` | FUN_1400028f8 | FUN_14000e494 | Enable/resume |
| `+0x16138` | FUN_140001ba4 | FUN_14000c814 | State getter |
| `+0x16140` | FUN_140001bbc | FUN_14000c82c | Activity check |
| `+0x16148` | FUN_140003838 | FUN_14000d06c | Secondary disp |
| `+0x16158` | FUN_14000303c | FUN_14000e59c | Aux cleanup |
| `+0x16160` | FUN_140003598 | FUN_14001023c | Queue cleanup |
| `+0x16168` | LAB_140002808 | FUN_1400100c0 | Status update |

The stub path installs `FUN_1400102d8` (safe no-op) everywhere.

### HwInitialize body (`FUN_140005ff4`)

Called from `FUN_140008638` after WDF class binding. It: registers two
power/PnP event handlers via service `+0x248`; reads the PnP hardware-ID and
compatible-ID strings via `+0x3f0` opcodes 1/2 (the NVMe-class detection);
reads the driver-version string via `+0x3f0` opcode 10; inserts the per-adapter
context into the global array at `DAT_140216780` (max 32); **calls
`FUN_140007d40` (the AHCI/NVMe split)**; programs interrupt steering via `+0x1a8`
(mask `0xfff`); and calls `+0x2f0` with a 0x50-byte block (likely MSI/X alloc).

### StorPort service-slot inventory

The only StorPort vtable entries that matter for porting (hit counts from
`rcbottom.sys` 9.3.2):

| Slot | Hits | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `+0xa8` / `+0xb0` / `+0xb8` | 7 each | DMA alloc / DMA→VA / DMA→PA |
| `+0xe8` | 2 | Set adapter parameters (interrupt model) |
| `+0x100` | 5 | DriverObject lookup |
| `+0x108` | 11 | Get adapter handle |
| `+0x188` | **11** | **Doorbell write (ring doorbell n)** |
| `+0x248` | many | Register event handler |
| `+0x3f0` | many | Read PnP / class strings |
| `+0x418` | 4 | WDF class bind (NOT a firmware accessor — see Debunked) |
| `+0x650` | 41 | Get devExt from adapter ctx |
| `+0x680` | 13 | StorPort logging / event |
| `+0x9d8` | **5** | **MMIO register-set programming (per-struct)** |
| `+0xdb0` | many | Debug print |

`+0x9d8` is the only mechanism in `rcbottom.sys` for programming queue
base/size/enable registers; each call passes a pointer to a small struct
describing "write these MMIO registers with these values." Its implementation
is inside storport.sys (out of scope); on Linux we replace it with direct
`writel()` to the NVMe BAR0 registers.

### Doorbell ordering

Two distinct sequences exist:
- **Init** (`FUN_140008638`, `0x140008969…`): order **1, 4, 2, 3**, signature
  `service_188(stor_ctx, adapter, idx, 1)` (note the extra `1`).
- **Re-arm** (`FUN_14000924c`): order **1, 2, 3, 4**, signature without the
  extra arg; runs after init.

Neither sequence is implemented in the Linux port, and none is needed: the
1-4-2-3 ordering belongs to the AHCI/StorPort `+0x188` template model, and the
NVMe path (`0xB000`) rings standard per-queue SQ/CQ doorbells at
`BAR0 + 0x1000 + (2*qid + dir) * (4 << CAP.DSTRD)` instead
(`rc_nvme_ring_sq_doorbell` in `rc_nvme.c`).  An earlier revision of this
section claimed a Linux `rc_activate_doorbells()` implemented the 1-4-2-3
order — no such function ever existed; the only related helper,
`rc_bottom_init_bar_templates()`, is deliberately a no-op.  Revisit only if
the AHCI path is ever built.

## NVMe queue init and multi-queue architecture

`FUN_14000dd44` is the NVMe queue-init callback (vtable `+0x16110`) for
`0xB000`. Structural details:

- I/O queue count = `min(devExt[+0xb0] − 1, 4)` — MSI vector count minus one,
  **hard-capped at 4** regardless of CPU count. Single-queue fallback if only 1
  vector (`devExt+0xb0 == 1`), hibernate path, or forced via `devExt+0xb4`.
- Each I/O queue handle is `0x78` bytes at `devExt + 0x15d98 + i*0x78`; the
  admin queue is index 0 (`devExt+0x15940` points at it).
- Per queue, allocate `0x30000` (192 KiB) DMA, 4 KiB-aligned. Layout confirmed
  from `FUN_14000f454`:

  | Offset | Size | Purpose |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0x00000 | 16 KiB | SQ entries (256 × 64 B) |
  | 0x08000 | 16 KiB | CQ entries (1024 × 16 B) |
  | 0x10000 | 128 KiB | PRP list region |
  | 0x18000 | 32 KiB | slack |

- Per-queue depth (`FUN_14000f454`): `SQ = min(MQES, 0x100) = 256`,
  `CQ = min(MQES, 0x400) = 1024`, where `MQES = CAP[15:0]` read from BAR0. On
  the dev box T700s `CAP=0x080000203c01ffff` → `MQES=0xffff`, so both clamp.
- Windows also keeps a static per-controller-per-queue command-tracking buffer
  of `0xf000` bytes (256 cmds × 120 B) at
  `&DAT_14021e8c0 + (queue + (ctrl_idx−1)*4)*0xf000`.

The `+0x9d8` calls at `FUN_140008a48` program the NVMe SQ/CQ base/size
registers (admin queue first, then the rest inside `FUN_14000f454`).

### Windows target → Linux (IMPLEMENTED)

Windows runs **4 I/O queues × SQ depth 256 = 1024 outstanding commands** per
controller. The Linux port **now matches this** (it was 1 queue × 64 in the
first bring-up):

| | Original Linux | Windows target | Linux today |
|---|---|---|---|
| I/O queues / controller | 1 | 4 | `RC_NVME_IO_QUEUE_TARGET = 4` |
| SQ depth / queue | 64 | 256 | `RC_NVME_IO_QUEUE_DEPTH = 256` |
| Total outstanding | 64 | 1024 | 1024 (4 × 256) |
| blk-mq `nr_hw_queues` | 1 | 4 | 4 (`queue_depth=256` → 1024) |

Implemented as: MSI→MSI-X migration (`pci_alloc_irq_vectors`, `N+1` vectors);
Set Features Number of Queues (admin opc 0x09, FID 0x07) at init; N SQ/CQ pairs
each with its own doorbells, DMA buffers, and MSI-X vector/ISR; blk-mq per-CPU
hctx with `.map_queues = blk_mq_pci_map_queues`; queue depth 256. The queue
count caps at `min(num_online_cpus, MSI-X vectors − 1, 4)` — on the dev box
(32+ CPUs, 128 MSI-X vectors) that resolves to 4, matching Windows.

Deliberate differences from Windows: no static cmd-tracking buffer (blk-mq
tagset does that — 256 tags × N queues × `sizeof(pdu)`, each request carries a
per-hctx PRP-list buffer); `scatterlist`-native DMA; **CQ depth 256, not
Windows' 1024** (the CQ is sized equal to the SQ — with at most 256 commands
outstanding per queue a 256-entry CQ can never overflow, so the 4× headroom
Windows allocates buys nothing; this follows Linux `nvme-core` convention);
and the software design follows Linux `nvme-core` patterns since the
on-the-wire NVMe protocol is spec-defined — the Windows RE only fixed the
*queue count/depth* target.

> The per-hctx dimension on the PRP-list pool matters: `req->tag` is unique
> only within one hctx, so two concurrent commands on different queues can draw
> the same tag and must not share a PRP buffer. See `rc_nvme.c`
> (`rc_volume_prp_va[hctx][member][tag]`).

## rcraid.sys geometry and metadata parsing

Ground truth for the on-disk RAID-metadata layout, verified against
`rcraid.sys` 9.3.2-00255. **Bottom line: the Linux driver's RAID0 geometry
parsing is correct** — chunk-size mapping, struct offsets, and RAID-level
magics all match the binary; the one uncertain field (member count) was settled
on hardware as `0x68`.

### Parse flow

| Function | Addr | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `RC_ReadMetaData` | `0x14001fd60` | reads the config packet off each member |
| `RC_BuildConfigMetadataFromRing` | `0x140019fb8` | walks the config ring: PhysicalDevice (`0x25bc`) then LogicalDevice (`0x25bd`) records |
| `FUN_140018444` | `0x140018444` | **copies on-disk LD packet → in-memory LD** (offset source of truth) |
| `FUN_14001c674` | `0x14001c674` | dispatches on DeviceType → installs per-RAID-level I/O handlers |
| `FUN_1400121d0` | `0x1400121d0` | **chunk_index → stripe-size mapping** |

Records are tag-prefixed `u32`s (`0x25bc` = `RC_DST_PHYSICAL_DEVICE`, `0x25bd`
= `RC_DST_LOGICAL_DEVICE`), walked until the tag no longer matches.

### On-disk LogicalDevice packet layout (verified)

From `FUN_140018444` (`param_2` = on-disk packet, `param_1` = in-memory LD):

| Field | On-disk offset | Linux `#define` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| record magic `0x25BD` | `+0x00` | `RC_DST_LOGICAL_DEVICE` | ✅ |
| DeviceType | `+0x0C` | `RC_LD_DEVICETYPE_OFFSET 0x0C` | ✅ |
| element-array offset | `+0x04` | `RC_LD_ELEMENTOFFSET_OFFSET 0x04` | ✅ |
| Capacity (u64) | `+0x50` | `RC_LD_CAPACITY_OFFSET 0x50` | ✅ |
| DEVICES (member count) | `+0x68` | `RC_LD_DEVICES_OFFSET 0x68` | ✅ **confirmed on hw (=2)** |
| FirstCount (stripe width) | `+0x6C` | `RC_LD_FIRSTCOUNT_OFFSET 0x6C` | ✅ **=2 on RAID0, =1 on RAID1 (hw)** |
| SecondCount (mirror count) | `+0x70` | `RC_LD_SECONDCOUNT_OFFSET 0x70` | ✅ **=1 on RAID0, =2 on RAID1 (hw)** |
| PacketSize | `+0x90` | `RC_LD_PACKETSIZE_OFFSET 0x90` | ✅ |
| ChunkSize (u32 sectors; 0 for RAID0) | `+0xAC` | `RC_LD_CHUNKSIZE_OFFSET 0xAC` | ✅ |
| chunk_index (u32) | `+0x110` | `RC_LD_CHUNKINDEX_OFFSET 0x110` | ✅ |

`FUN_140018444` defaults chunk_index to 1 when the on-disk field is 0. The
per-member `RC_LogicalElement` `UserDataOffset` at LE `+0x20` is each member's
physical data offset (`ld_userdata_offset`; = 1069056 sectors on the
workstation array).

### chunk_index → stripe size (verified — the main "guess")

`FUN_1400121d0` maps chunk_index (in-mem `piVar2[0x32]` ← on-disk `+0x110`) to
a stripe size in 512-byte sectors:

```c
if (chunk_index == 3)      size = 0x200;   // 512 sectors = 256 KiB
else { size = 0x80;                        // 128 sectors =  64 KiB (default)
       if (chunk_index == 2) size = 0x100; } // 256 sectors = 128 KiB
```

Identical to the Linux `rc_volume_chunk_sectors_for` (`case 3 → 512`,
`case 2 → 256`, `case 1/default → 128`). Windows handles only `2` and `3`
explicitly; every other value (including `1` and `0`→`1`) falls to 64 KiB.
**There is no index ≥ 4 handling** — see the latent gap below.

### DeviceType → RAID level: the on-disk truth is FirstCount × SecondCount

`FUN_14001c674` switches on DeviceType (in-mem `+4` ← on-disk `+0x0C`):

| DeviceType | RAID level | Linux `#define` |
|---|---|---|
| `0x1BF5` | (RAID-related; not in Linux enum) | — |
| `0x1BF6` | RAID0 | `RC_LDT_RAID0` ✅ |
| `0x1BF7` | RAID1 | `RC_LDT_RAID1` (never yet seen on disk) |
| `0x1BF9` | (per-member "raw disk" variant) | `RC_LDT_SINGLE` |
| `0x1BFA` | RAID5 | `RC_LDT_RAID5` ✅ |
| `0x1BFB` | RAID10 | `RC_LDT_RAID10` |

**Hardware correction (2026-07-10, TRX50 metadata dumps during RAID1
validation): firmware writes DeviceType `0x1BF6` for BIOS-created RAID1
volumes too.** The record for the live 2-disk RAID1 reads
`devtype=0x1BF6, FirstCount=1, SecondCount=2, Capacity=<one member's user
size>`; the old RAID0's record reads `devtype=0x1BF6, FirstCount=2,
SecondCount=1, Capacity=<2× user size>`. So the on-disk RAID level is
encoded as **FirstCount × SecondCount = stripe width × mirror count**
(`FirstCount * SecondCount == Devices` on every observed record, including
the `0x1BF9` raw-disk LDs at 1×1), and `0x1BF6` is best read as "generic
striped/mirrored volume". Whatever the `0x1BF7` dispatch arm in
`FUN_14001c674` consumes, it is not what this firmware writes to disk —
the Windows in-memory DeviceType is presumably recomputed from the counts.
The Linux driver derives the level from the counts (`rc_ld_level_from`)
and refuses combinations it has no dispatch path for. This encoding was
independently corroborated on X399 SATA RAID10 (`FirstCount=2,
SecondCount=2, devices=4`) — see
[External corroboration](#external-corroboration-x399-zenith-extreme-sata-raid10)
below.

AMD also writes one single-device "raw disk" LD per physical member
(`devtype=0x1BF9, devices=1, capacity=NSZE`); the parser skips those by
checking whether our `DeviceId` appears in the element array.

### Member count resolved: `0x68`, not `0x70`

`FUN_140018444` copies three adjacent counts (`0x68`→`[0x2c]`, `0x6C`→`[0x2d]`,
`0x70`→`[0x2e]`). A static read of the striping calc suggested `0x70` might be
authoritative, but **on-hardware logging disproved it**: on the healthy
2-member RAID0, `devices(0x68)=2` and `second_count(0x70)=1`. So `0x68` is the
member count (Linux is correct). The 2026-07-10 RAID1 dumps then identified
what `0x70` actually is — the **mirror count** (see the FirstCount ×
SecondCount section above): keying off it on RAID0 would have mis-counted the
array as 1 member, and the "forensic" logging of it is what let the RAID1
level encoding be recognized. A clean example of empirical validation
catching a plausible-but-wrong decompiler inference — twice.

### Config ring is a journal; the commit block names the active generation

**Verified on hardware (2026-07-10), found the hard way.** The config ring
(LBA `0x5800`, `ConfigRingSize`=2048 sectors) is not a table — it is a
journal of complete config **generations**, appended on every config change
(array create/delete, and periodically: the dumps show ~19 generations for
a handful of user actions). Each generation is:

```
+0x000  header sector: u64 timestamp, then intra-generation table offsets
+0x200  packed records: PhysicalDevice (0x25BC) × N, LogicalDevice (0x25BD) × M
```

Deleted arrays' LD records **persist in older generations** with no
tombstone — the whole generation is simply superseded. The **config-commit
block** (one sector at `RC_MetaData.ConfigCommitOffset`, `0x5001` on every
observed disk) is the two-phase-commit pointer that names the live
generation:

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| `+0x00` | u64 commit-write timestamp |
| `+0x08` | u32 active generation start LBA |
| `+0x0C` | u32 active generation length, bytes |
| `+0x10` | u64 active generation's timestamp (== gen header `+0x00`) |
| `+0x30` | u32 generation sequence number |

Consequence: **scanning the ring from the start and taking the first LD
whose element array contains the disk's DeviceID assembles a DEAD array.**
DeviceIDs are per-physical-disk and survive array delete/create, so a
deleted RAID0's record matches the same disks as the live RAID1 created
after it. That exact bug shipped and presented a deleted 2-disk RAID0 (4 TB,
striped, writable) in place of the live RAID1 (2 TB, mirrored) during
hardware validation — caught only because the size looked wrong before the
OS install. The parser must read the commit block, validate the extent and
the timestamp linkage, and only trust records inside the committed
generation. One quirk: the live generation carries the volume LD **twice**
(identical geometry, two trailing fields differing — possibly
current-vs-target tables for migration); first match within the committed
extent is safe precisely because they agree.

### Latent gap: chunk_index ≥ 4

Neither Windows (9.3.2 **or** 9.3.3) nor the Linux driver handles
`chunk_index ≥ 4`; both silently fall back to 64 KiB. If a future
RAIDXpert2/firmware ever encodes a 512 KiB or 1 MiB stripe as index 4/5, both
drivers would mis-map and corrupt data on write. The gap is inherent to AMD's
encoding, not a version quirk. The Linux driver's fail-closed guard (mark
unrecognized chunk_index untrusted) covers it — the geometry write-veto alone
would not, since the LD parses fine and only the stripe size is wrong.

### Cross-version check (9.3.3-00291)

Same pipeline on 9.3.3: the binary differs (SHA256 `3f241608…` vs `f0a6fc8b…`,
+2,952 B) but the **geometry parsing is unchanged** — identical chunk_index
ladder (no index ≥ 4), same `[0x32]`←`+0x110` field, same ChunkSize `+0xAC`,
same RAID-level magics (`0x1BF6/7/A/B`). All geometry conclusions hold for
9.3.3 because the code is unchanged, not because the binary is.

### External corroboration: X399 (Zenith Extreme) SATA RAID10

Reported in issue #57 (George "PlaidPiper" Crossley, 2026-10). A
firmware-created **SATA** RAID10 over 4× WD100EMAZ on X399 (Zenith
Extreme) parses to the same packet this driver expects:

| Field | Observed |
|---|---|
| `DeviceType` (`+0x0C`) | `0x1BF6` (generic striped/mirrored) |
| `devices` (`0x68`) | 4 |
| `FirstCount × SecondCount` | `2 × 2` |
| `chunk_index` (`+0x110`) | `1` → 64 KiB |
| per-member `UserDataOffset` (LE `+0x20`) | 1069056 sectors |

All four members carried byte-identical committed records, and the config
ring's **stale generations were correctly skipped** — the same
journal/commit-block semantics documented above. He assembled a
**read-only** view with `dm-stripe` over the two columns (one member per
mirror pair, chunk-interleaved) and mounted it `ntfs3` with the MFT
parsing cleanly (~395 MB/s sustained).

What this establishes, on firmware years older and on a different bus
than the TRX50 NVMe dumps: the `FirstCount = stripe columns`,
`SecondCount = mirror depth` encoding; the committed-generation journal
behaviour; the `chunk_index` ladder; and the column-chunk interleave
model (`logical chunk N` → column `N mod cols`, physical chunk
`N div cols`, both copies).

What it does **not** establish: the `1022:B000` NVMe path (bring-up,
completion, degraded failover, rebuild — separate code, never run here),
and it does not settle whether a column's two copies are **adjacent**
(`{2c, 2c+1}`, the Linux driver's current assumption) or **strided**
(`{c, c+cols}`) — the members were not cross-dumped. Comparing a small
raw region past each member's `UserDataOffset` would settle it, since
mirror copies are byte-identical.

## Debunked theories (do not re-investigate)

Each wasted significant effort in the 2024 analysis round. They are wrong; the
2024 docs under `docs/archive/legacy_2024/` still describe them and are
retained only as historical record.

- **"Descriptor accessor at `devExt+0x1C2D0`"** — it's the WDF/KMDF class-bind
  function pointer installed by service `+0x418`, not a firmware-capability
  accessor.
- **`DAT_140012258` "firmware capability blob"** — it's the WDF version-bind
  table (GUIDs + KMDF strings like `"KmdfLibrary"`, `"ZPODDWORKITEM"`).
  Confirmed by the hex dump in
  `docs/ghidra_output/rcbottom_9.3.2/firmware_descriptor_blob.txt`. The
  "opcodes" `0x05/0x10/0x11/0x34/…` are WDF API indices, varying by
  device-family because different families bind different WDF versions.
- **`FUN_14002ce29`** — outside `rcbottom.sys` (binary ends near
  `0x14001a700`); the function does not exist in this binary.
- **"40-entry controller descriptor table" (`DAT_1400140B0`)** — never existed.
- **Completion register writes at `BAR0 + 0x100 + qid*0x10`** — those are AHCI
  port registers, wrong for `0xB000` by construction.

**Implication:** there is no descriptor accessor to reimplement. Everything the
driver needs comes from PCI config space (vendor/device/class) and the NVMe
controller registers in BAR0, both of which Linux exposes directly.

## Open questions

Still needing Ghidra investigation. Run via `scripts/ghidra/HuntBlockers.java`
(command line in `docs/README.md`).

### High priority — the NVMe path to issue commands

1. **`FUN_14000f608` (rcbottom.sys)** — per-queue MMIO arming, called from
   `FUN_14000dd44` once per I/O queue. We have the prep code (DMA alloc, handle
   layout) in `ghidra_output/rcbottom_9.3.2/key_funcs.c` but not this. Want:
   doorbell stride/base confirmation (`BAR0 + 0x1000` vs vendor-specific);
   Create-IO-CQ/SQ command shapes if AMD uses non-standard fields; whether it
   pre-creates the CQ via admin or programs MMIO directly.
2. **`rcraid.sys` NVMe completion ISR (`FUN_14000d2b8`)** — never decompiled.
   Want: exact CQ entry layout (16-byte NVMe-spec vs AMD extension); phase-bit
   walk vs head-pointer DMA write-back; how error/Identify completions route
   back to the submitter.
3. **Per-namespace discovery in `rcraid.sys`** — where it issues Identify and
   assembles RAID metadata. Want: any vendor-specific RAID-enumeration opcode
   (or confirmation it's all standard Identify + Read); the metadata
   signature/version constants.

### Medium priority

4. **Service-slot `+0x9d8` struct shape** — called 5× with a "program these
   MMIO registers" struct (see
   `ghidra_output/rcbottom_9.3.2/indirect_call_offsets.txt`). Not strictly
   needed (we replaced it with direct `writel` in NVMe mode), but tracing
   `FUN_140008a48`'s argument shape would let us write a general helper and drop
   the duplicated code in `rc_hw.c`.

### Low priority — only if the controller refuses to come ready

5. **`FUN_140008f34` BAR discovery** — walks `MmMapIoSpace`-ed BARs into the
   device extension; should match Linux `pci_iomap`. Re-read if the
   `rc_nvme_init_controller` read-back fails.
6. **Vendor PCI config writes before MMIO bring-up** — `FUN_140005ff4` calls
   `+0xa8/+0xb0/+0xb8/+0xe8/+0x108/+0x188` first. Mostly DMA setup, but `+0xe8`
   (a 0x1c-byte struct `0x1c,4,2,2,2,2,1`) may set adapter parameters we don't
   replicate. Worth a look if NVMe init produces a controller fatal status.

### Resolved

- **Volume-metadata parsing** — fully understood (see "rcraid geometry" above,
  cross-checked against DWARF in the AMD Linux SDK's `rcblob.x86_64`). The
  516-byte `RC_LogicalDevice` (`__packed__`, first u32 = `0x25BD`) in the config
  ring at `ConfigRingOffset` (LBA 0x5800 on the dev box) yields member count
  (`+0x68`), element-array offset (`+0x04`), capacity (`+0x50`), DeviceType
  (`+0x0C`), and per-member `DeviceID` matching for position.
- **9.3.2 vs 9.3.3 binary diff** — done (see "Version delta"): binaries differ
  but the data-path/geometry code is functionally identical. Re-run the string
  diff if a 9.3.4 ships.

## Reproducing the analysis

Ghidra 12 needs JDK 17+. The project is stored outside the repo.

```sh
export JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-21.0.11.10-hotspot"

# Re-import (binaries are no longer in the tree — first restore them
# with `git checkout 69738ee -- drivers/` or download from AMD)
"C:\Program Files\ghidra_12.1_PUBLIC\support\analyzeHeadless.bat" \
  C:/Users/dev/ghidra_projects amd-raid \
  -import drivers/windows/trx50/9.3.2-00255/rcbottom/rcbottom.sys -overwrite

# Re-run the hunt (writes into docs/ghidra_output/rcbottom_9.3.2/)
"C:\Program Files\ghidra_12.1_PUBLIC\support\analyzeHeadless.bat" \
  C:/Users/dev/ghidra_projects amd-raid \
  -process rcbottom.sys -noanalysis \
  -scriptPath scripts/ghidra -postScript HuntBlockers.java \
  docs/ghidra_output/rcbottom_9.3.2
```

For targeted decompiles (PyGhidra venv, `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` set):

```python
import pyghidra; pyghidra.start()
from ghidra.app.decompiler import DecompInterface
from ghidra.util.task import ConsoleTaskMonitor
with pyghidra.open_program(SYS, analyze=True) as api:
    prog = api.getCurrentProgram()
    dec = DecompInterface(); dec.openProgram(prog)
    addr = prog.getAddressFactory().getDefaultAddressSpace().getAddress(0x1400121d0)
    f = prog.getFunctionManager().getFunctionContaining(addr)
    print(dec.decompileFunction(f, 60, ConsoleTaskMonitor()).getDecompiledFunction().getC())
```
