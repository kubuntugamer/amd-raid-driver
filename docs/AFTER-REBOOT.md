**Why:** the firmware array can only be created in the RAIDXpert2 UEFI
utility. That is the only reason — on the installed OS the module signing key
(`CN=minerva Secure Boot Module Signature key`) is **already enrolled** in MOK
and its fingerprint matches `/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der` there, so
signing `rcraid.ko` works without a second reboot **on that system**. The
live-USB session uses a separate local key; see the status note above.

**The rule for this run: the driver stays out of the initramfs.** Do not run
`install-dkms.sh`, `install-livecd.sh`, or `update-initramfs` before the array
exists and has been read-validated by hand. The packaged udev rule keys off
`subsystem_vendor`, which is `0x1987` on all four drives (OS included), and
`rcraid-bind` would unbind `nvme` from the OS controller before root is
mounted. See "Why not the initramfs" at the end.

---

## 1. Before you reboot

Record which physical drive the OS is on — you will need the serial inside the
UEFI utility:

```bash
lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,SERIAL,MOUNTPOINTS
findmnt -no SOURCE,FSTYPE /
```

Last seen: OS = `/dev/nvme2n1p2` (XFS `/`) on the controller at **16:00.0**,
with `nvme0n1`, `nvme1n1`, `nvme3n1` blank and available. Confirm, don't assume.

## 2. In the UEFI (RAIDXpert2)

**Del** at boot → *Advanced* → *RAIDXpert2 Configuration Utility* → *Array
Management* → *Create Array*.

- Select the **three blank Sabrent drives only**, identified by serial — not
  by position or model string.
- RAID level **RAID 5**, all three members, *Create Array*, then *Apply
  Changes* and confirm the array reads `Optimal`.
- **Do not include the OS drive.** Putting it in the array makes the machine
  unbootable, and the data on it is not recoverable from this session. Tick
  exactly these three serials and nothing else:

  | Slot | Serial | Size |
  |------|--------|------|
  | `03:00.0` | `7C550718046F00004936` | 3.6 T |
  | `11:00.0` | `912807140FF600124174` | 3.6 T |
  | `15:00.0` | `9128071610F600182290` | 3.6 T |

  The OS drive is `912807140FF600124197` at `16:00.0` — it is the same model,
  size and firmware as the others, so serial is the only reliable identifier.

- Before saving and exiting: **Boot** tab → confirm `ubuntu` is still first in
  boot order. Creating an array can add an `AMD RAID`-style entry, and if that
  entry is selected the firmware finds no bootable image on the array and the
  boot fails. The `ubuntu` entry lives on `nvme2n1p1` and stays valid as long
  as the array does not include that drive.

RAID 6 needs four members, so it is not possible with the current disk set.
A 3-disk RAID 5 gives you 2 disks of usable capacity and single-disk
redundancy.

## 3. First checks after boot (driver not loaded yet)

```bash
uname -r                              # expect 7.3.0-10-generic
lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINTS   # no rcraid0 yet — that is correct
lspci -d 1022:b000
sudo dmesg | grep -i rcraid           # should be silent
```

Linux cannot see the array until `rcraid` is loaded; the volumes only appear
after the module parses the firmware metadata.

Confirm the signing key survived the array creation. It was enrolled before
this reboot (`CN=minerva Secure Boot Module Signature key`); a BIOS reset can
clear MOK, so re-check rather than assume:

```bash
mokutil --sb-state
mokutil --list-enrolled | grep -i minerva     # expect a SHA1 line + subject
```

If it is absent, the driver cannot load with Secure Boot on:
`sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der`, set a one-time
password, reboot and complete the MOK manager prompt, then resume at step 4.

## 4. Build, sign, load

```bash
cd /home/chazz/amd-raid-driver
make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M="$PWD" modules

sudo "/usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file" sha256 \
    /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der \
    rcraid.ko

sudo insmod ./rcraid.ko
lsblk
sudo dmesg | tail -40
```

`insmod` alone will print `probe` messages for **nothing**: the PCI core never
steals a device already bound to `nvme`, so the module loads and claims 0
adapters. That is expected, not a failure. Because the udev rule and initramfs
hook are deliberately **not** installed (the rule keys off `subsystem_vendor`,
which is `0x1987` on all four drives, so it cannot tell the OS disk apart),
hand the three array members to `rcbottom` by hand — **never `16:00.0`, that is the OS drive**:

```bash
for d in 0000:03:00.0 0000:11:00.0 0000:15:00.0; do
    echo rcbottom | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/$d/driver_override
    echo "$d"    | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/nvme/unbind
    echo "$d"    | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers_probe
done
lsblk
sudo dmesg | tail -40
```

Confirm the slots are the members before trusting them — serials are
`7C550718046F00004936` (03), `912807140FF600124174` (11),
`9128071610F600182290` (15); the OS drive is `912807140FF600124197` (16).

To undo (rebind to `nvme`, no reboot needed):

```bash
sudo rmmod rcraid
for d in 0000:03:00.0 0000:11:00.0 0000:15:00.0; do
    sudo sh -c "echo '' > /sys/bus/pci/devices/$d/driver_override"
    echo "$d" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers_probe
done
```

Expect `rcraid0` to appear with the level the metadata declares. Inspect it:

```bash
cat /sys/block/rcraid0/rcraid/state
cat /sys/block/rcraid0/rcraid/members
cat /sys/block/rcraid0/size
```

## 5. What a 3-disk RAID 5 should and should not do

This tree **assembles and reads parity volumes but refuses writes** — that is
the current Phase 1 behaviour, not a regression.

```bash
# read must succeed (O_DIRECT so the page cache cannot mask a failure)
sudo dd if=/dev/rcraid0 of=/dev/null bs=1M count=64 iflag=direct status=progress

# write must be refused with EIO; nothing on the disks should change
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rcraid0 bs=1M count=1 conv=fsync
```

Record the outcome in `docs/STATUS.md` under a new dated entry: whether the
volume assembled, the level the driver reported, the read result, the exact
write-refusal message, and the member tuple from the LD record.

Do **not** `mkfs`, mount read-write, or otherwise treat it as a usable volume,
and do not expect degraded operation to be safe — parity rebuild is not
implemented (only RAID 1/RAID 10 resync exists), so a 3-disk RAID 5 missing a
member is read-only at best.

## 6. If the array does not assemble

Capture, in this order:

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep -iE "rcraid|nvme" > /tmp/reboot-dmesg.txt
sudo dd if=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=512 skip=20480 count=1 2>/dev/null | head -c 32 | xxd
sudo python3 scripts/qemu-test/mkmeta.py --help
```

The sector at LBA `0x5000` must carry magic `RAIDCore` at `+0x08` (the first
8 bytes are the checksum) — `mkmeta.py` writes exactly that layout to files or
real block devices. Compare the LD record's device tuple against the
X399 fixtures in `PlaidPiper/x399-raidcore-fixtures`; a new tuple shape is a
parser gap, not corruption. Write findings to `docs/STATUS.md` before fixing
anything.

## 7. Work queue once the hardware run is recorded

Order from `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.MD` ("Suggested next-PR order"):

1. **Metadata writer for RAID 10** — `scripts/qemu-test/mkmeta.py` lists
   `raid5`/`raid10` in `LEVELS` but `main()` exits with "metadata is untested"
   for both, so those choices dead-end. 3×2 RAID 10 adjacency is still
   unconfirmed (`docs/VALIDATION_RAID10.md`, step 1) — prefer 2×2 until checked.
2. **Verify `/dev/amd_ctl0`** — the bridge is now registered as a `misc`
   device and routed at the live volume. After the module loads, check the
   node exists, `GET_STATUS`/`GET_HARDWARE_INVENTORY` work as a normal user,
   and `FAIL_MEMBER` returns `-EPERM` without root. `START_RESYNC` is still
   RAID 1/10 only; RAID 5 correctly returns `-EOPNOTSUPP`.
3. **H-5** — trace where `ctrl_mode` is set relative to `spin_lock_init()` and
   IRQ registration in `rc_hw_init()`, then annotate `docs/AUDIT.MD` as fixed
   or open. It is the only High still marked "not re-checked".
4. **Support matrix** — if this boot is on a kernel newer than the
   `docs/README.md` claim, update the validated-through version.

Regression testing without hardware (no reboot needed, but `/tmp` was cleared):

```bash
./scripts/qemu-test/run-qemu-raid-test.sh --kver "$(uname -r)" \
    --level raid1 --fail-member --workdir /tmp/raid-check
```

Degraded mode is selected by flag, not by level name — `--fail-member` kills
a member at runtime, `--omit-member` boots with one detached (`allow_degraded=1`).
CI runs exactly those four: `raid0`, `raid1`, `raid1 --fail-member`,
`raid1 --omit-member`.

## 8. Guardrails

- **Never** write to `16:00.0` / `/dev/nvme2n1*` — that is the live OS disk.
- Baseline the machine again before any test: `rcraid` not loaded, no
  `/dev/amd_ctl0`, `/` still on XFS.
- `gh` is authenticated user-wide via the keyring token; if it expires,
  `gh auth login --web` and `gh auth setup-git` restores it.

## 9. Why not the initramfs (until the rule is fixed)

`packaging/udev/50-rcraid.rules.in` fires on **every** `1022:b000` device whose
`subsystem_vendor` matches `@SUBSYSTEM_VENDOR@` and calls
`packaging/sbin/rcraid-bind`, which sets `driver_override=rcbottom` and unbinds
`nvme`. The filter exists to protect the OS disk — but on this box all four
drives report `0x1987/0x5012`, so it matches the OS disk too.

Inside an initramfs that sequence is unrecoverable: `nvme` is unbound from
`16:00.0`, `rcbottom` probes it and resets the controller (`CC.EN=0`), and
because `nvme2n1` carries no `RAIDCore` metadata no volume is assembled and no
block device appears. `/dev/nvme2n1p2` never exists, so `pivot_root` fails.
Recovery is a live USB or a GRUB `modprobe.blacklist=rcraid` edit.

Binding by hand (step 4) is the same operation, scoped to three BDFs, run after
the OS is already up. The fix that makes the initramfs path safe is a
serial/BDF allowlist in the rule and in `rcraid-bind`, not a config tweak —
track it in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.MD`.
