# Userspace concurrency harness for the async mirror engine.
#
# src/test_async_worker_harness.c #includes the REAL src/patch_async_worker.c
# behind a shim for the kernel primitives, so it runs the engine's actual
# locking and accounting code under real threads and real preemption — which is
# where bugs in this kind of code live, and where a module on a RAID box with no
# spare machine to debug on cannot be observed.  It needs no kernel headers at
# all, so it deliberately does not touch KERNELDIR and is not an rcraid-objs
# member.
#
# The engine #includes <linux/*.h>, which do not exist in userspace.  The target
# materializes empty stand-ins in a scratch include dir: the harness defines
# every primitive itself before including the engine, so the preprocessor only
# needs those paths to resolve.  Generating them beats checking in a fake
# linux/ tree, which would otherwise invite editor indexers and greps into it.
#
# Drain budget is shortened from the engine's 5000 ms default because the
# stuck-member unload test is deliberately slower than any real drain.
